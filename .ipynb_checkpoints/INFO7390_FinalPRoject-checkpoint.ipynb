    "We all know self-driving cars is one of the hottest areas of research and business for the tech giants. What seemed like a science-fiction, a few years ago, now seems more like something which is soon to become a part and parcel of life. The reason, I am saying “soon to be” is because of the fact that even though companies like Tesla, Nissan, Cadillac do have self-driving car assistance software, but, they still require a human to keep an eye on the road and take control when needed. However, it is fascinating to see how far we have come in terms of innovation and how fast technology is advancing. So much so, that now, with the help of basic deep learning, neural network magic, we can build our own pipeline for autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our idea to try and build our very own self driving car emerged from here. In order to understand the basics of the process , we did this project in two parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Self Driving Car using Supervised Learning\n",
    "- Self Driving Car using Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**PS- To make you understand the structure for the same, We have done this project in 3 parts, and all 3 parts are divided into seperate notebooks. And these individual notebooks contain the whole code and documentation of the entire part.\n",

    "### 1. Basics of CNN :- \n",
    "\n",
    "The main agenda of this notebook is as follow:-\n",
    "> - To understand the convolution operation\n",
    "> - To understand the pooling operation\n",
    "> - Remembering the vocabulary used in convolutional neural networks (padding, stride, filter, etc.)\n",
    "> - Building a convolutional neural network for multi-class classification in images\n",
    ">- Basics of Imitation Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes the basics of convolutional operations and whole network in general. This was a very integral part of our project and will serve as a guide for any beginner trying to understand CNN .\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Self Driving Car using Supervised Learning :- \n",
    "In this notebook ,we applied a supervised learning algorithm (convolution networks), to control the direction of a car in a 2D simulation. The notebook captures the following:-\n",

    "> - How to create the dataset and use it for training our network\n",
    "> - How to use gym to retrieve the output of our neural network in order to control the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea that we used is that of the supervised classifier. We are going to train a convolutional neural network to classify images in the game, according to three labels: left, right and straight ahead. We will then convert these commands into instructions for the simulator, which will execute them.\n",

    "### 4.  Self Driving Car using Reinforcement Learning :-\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a python based car racing environment is trained using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to perform efficient self driving on a racing track. The notebook captures the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Development of a deep Q learning algorithm which is then used to train an autonomous driver agent. \n",
    "> - Different configurations in the deep Q learning algorithm parameters and in the neural network architecture are then tested and compared in order to obtain the best racing car average score over a period of 100 races. This score is given by the gym environment and can be seen on the bottom left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to OpenAI Gym, this environment is considered solved when the agent successfully reaches an average score of 900 on the last 100 runs. In this project, this goal was surpassed having obtained an average score of 905 over the last 100 runs. Therefore, we successfully solved the environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start with the setup of our environment, we need to install a few pakages which will make our game and neural network work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Gym facility\n",
    "Install OpenAI Gym on the machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions at https://github.com/openai/gym#installation for extensive and deep guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of instructions:**\n",
    "- Install Python 3.5+\n",
    "- Clone the gym repo: git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git\n",
    "- cd gym\n",
    "- Gym installation, with the box2d environments: pip install -e '.[box2d]'\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the following steps to play the Car Racing Game\n",
    "- cd gym/envs/box2d\n",
    "- python car_racing.py\n",

    "### 2) Pytorch\n",
    "Pytorch is the deep learning framework that we will be using. It makes it possible to build neural networks very simply.\n",

    "- Install PyTorch following instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/\n",
    "![title](Umbrella_Academy_INFO7390_Project\\Pytorch_Installation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example this is the setup for my Computer\n",

    "## The Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the gym library developed by OpenAI. It provides environments (simple games) to develop reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment we will be using is CarRacing-v0 ( https://gym.openai.com/envs/CarRacing-v0/ ). It is about driving a car on a circuit, the objective being to move forward while staying on the track, which contains many turns. The input to the algorithm (the state provided by the environment) is only the image displayed by the environment: we see the car, and the terrain around it.\n",
    "![title](Umbrella_Academy_INFO7390_Project\\car-racing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to drive the car by analyzing this image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use this library in a roundabout way: It is designed for reinforcement learning. The objective is in principle to use the rewards (rewards) provided by the environment to learn the optimal strategy without user action. Here we will not be using these rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will be doing end-to-end learning , which means that the neural network will directly give us the commands to navigate the car. This is not a road detection module, which will then be analyzed by another program (most true autonomous driving systems are made this way). Here, the neural network takes the field matrix as input, and issues a command to be executed (turn left, turn right, continue straight ahead), without any intermediate program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the environment, you need to import it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">import gym\n",
    "\n",
    ">env = gym.make('CarRacing-v0').env\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then access several useful functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **env.reset() :** Allows you to restart the environment\n",
    "- **env.step(action) :** Allows you to perform the action `action`. This function returns a tuple `state`, `reward`, `done`, `info` containing the state of the game after the action, the reward obtained, doneindicates if the game is finished, and infocontains debug data.\n",
    "- **env.render() :** Displays the game window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the state `state` that will be returned by env.step(action)is the image displayed on the screen (the pixel matrix). It is this data that we will use to steer our car."
